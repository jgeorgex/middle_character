#### Get the Middle Character(s)

### Requirements

The program runs in a repl like IRB or in the browser console

It's fine to use Ruby or JavaScript.

Your job is to return the middle character of a word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

### Acceptance Criteria

getMiddle("test") # => "es"
getMiddle("testing") # => "t"
getMiddle("middle") # => "dd"
getMiddle("A") # => "A"
getMiddle("of") # => "of"

### Test Plan & Notes

Vanilla JS process practice to refamiliarise.

a => a
b => b
ab => ab
abc => b
abcd => bc
abcde => c
Then test for acceptance criteria
